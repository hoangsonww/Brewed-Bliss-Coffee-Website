# Brewed Bliss Coffee Website ☕

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Brewed Bliss Coffee**, is the final project for the **COMP-126** class at **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** under the instruction of **Professor Tessa Joseph-Nicholas**. It is a comprehensive, fully-responsive website designed for a soon-to-open coffee shop, Brewed Bliss, located in Chapel Hill, NC. The website aims to provide an engaging and immersive experience for users.

## Project Objectives

The purpose of this project is to apply client-driven web development principles, as taught in COMP-126, to build a multi-page website that meets the needs of a business client (in this case, Brewed Bliss - a soon-to-open coffee shop in Chapel Hill, NC). The project follows best practices in HTML, CSS, and JS to create a responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
