# Brewed Bliss Coffee Website ☕

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Brewed Bliss Coffee**, is the final project for the **COMP-126** class at **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** under the instruction of **Professor Tessa Joseph-Nicholas**. It is a comprehensive, fully-responsive website designed for a soon-to-open coffee shop, Brewed Bliss, located in Chapel Hill, NC. The website aims to provide an engaging and immersive experience for ALL users, including both customers and potential business partners.

## Project Objectives

The purpose of this project is to apply client-driven web development principles, as taught in COMP-126, to build a multi-page website that meets the needs of a business client (in this case, Brewed Bliss - a soon-to-open coffee shop in Chapel Hill, NC). The project follows best practices in HTML, CSS, and JS to create a responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

All requirements are ensured to be met, including mobile-first design, responsive layout, accessibility considerations, and a focus on user experience. This website is also carefully designed to be engaging, informative, and visually appealing to all users, regardless of their device or accessibility needs!

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Alt Text on All Images**: Each image includes alt text for visually impaired users.
- **Color Contrast**: Colors were chosen to meet WCAG standards (with all colors meeting at least the AA requirement) for contrast to ensure their readability.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: All navigation and interactive elements can be accessed via keyboard input as well.
